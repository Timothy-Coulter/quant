# Utility presets

Support configs for caches, logging, and formatting helpers used across the stack.

- `cache.yaml`: cache directories, TTLs, and max-entries for data/indicator caches.
- `logging.yaml`: structured logging defaults with run_id/thread info.

These are plain mappings intended for helper modules or fixtures; adjust paths as needed for your environment.
