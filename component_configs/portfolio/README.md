# Portfolio presets

`PortfolioConfig` snapshots for allocation engines.

- `general.yaml`: single-pool, long-only baseline with modest leverage and 10 position cap.
- `dual_pool.yaml`: base/alpha split with leverage and maintenance margin controls.
- `defensive.yaml`: capital-preserving setup with higher cash buffer and tighter risk.

Use alongside strategy configs to control sizing, spreads, and financing assumptions.
