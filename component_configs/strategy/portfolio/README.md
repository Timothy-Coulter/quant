# Portfolio strategy configs

`PortfolioStrategyConfig` presets for allocation engines.

- `equal_weight.yaml`: passive equal weight with signal filters.
- `risk_parity.yaml`: inverse-volatility weighting with risk budgets.
- `kelly.yaml`: Kelly-derived sizing with conviction multipliers.

Include risk budgets, constraints, rebalance cadence, and optional filters per strategy.
